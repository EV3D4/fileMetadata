# fileMetadata


**User Story #1:**  I can submit a form object that includes a file upload.

**User Story #2:** The from file input field has the "name" attribute set to "upfile". We rely on this in testing.

**User Story #3:** When I submit something, I will receive the file name, and size in bytes within the JSON response.
